# pixi-legacy

Sometimes things break. Sometimes new API is introduced. Sometimes old API gets deprecated.

Sometimes everyone is drunk on friday night, and only @ivanpopelyshev saves the situation by adding new plugin

This plugin allows to use new API's with old versions of PIXI, starting from v3.0.11

It is also supposed to add old API's and remove things that were "deprecated" and used widely

Binaries are in "bin" folder.
